## Introduction
In Assignment07 we were asked to apply our knowledge of pickling data and basic error exception handling. For this assignment, I used assignment06 as a template and stuck with menu processing logic to manage a Task List.  I changed the selections from a numeric choice to an alpha character and included an option to display the current Task list.
