## Introduction
In Assignment07 we were asked to apply our knowledge of pickling data and basic error exception handling. For this assignment, I used assignment06 as a template and stuck with menu processing logic to manage a Task List.  I changed the selections from a numeric choice to an alpha character and included an option to display the current Task list.

Here is an example of my menu options:
        Menu of Options
        (l) Load Task list from file
        (a) Add a new Task
        (i) Display current Task list
        (r) Remove an existing Task
        (s) Save Task list to file
        (x) Exit Program

Similar to Assignment06, the Python code was broken out into three sections:

### Section one: A function class for Data Processing was defined that included two functions:

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jjohanne514/FDN_110_Assignment07/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
